## Technical Indicator Glossary
### Main Explanation
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**
  - **Description**: RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures overbought or oversold conditions in the price of an asset on a scale of 0 to 100.
  - **Principle**: It compares the magnitude of recent gains to recent losses to evaluate the speed and change of price movements.
  - **Signal Interpretation**:
    - **Below 30**: Indicates oversold conditions, suggesting potential buy signals.
    - **Above 70**: Indicates overbought conditions, suggesting potential sell signals.
  - **Signal Line Crossings**:
    - **RSI Crossing Above RSI_signal**: Increases the likelihood of an upward price movement, indicating strengthening bullish momentum.
    - **RSI Crossing Below RSI_signal**: Indicates weakening momentum, suggesting a potential bearish trend.

- **RSI_signal**
  - **Description**: A secondary RSI value used to confirm signals generated by the primary RSI.
  - **Principle**: By comparing two RSI values, it enhances the reliability of the trading signals by ensuring that both indicators align before taking action.
  - **Signal Line Crossings**:
    - **RSI Crossing Above RSI_signal**: Confirms a stronger buy signal and enhances confidence in an impending price increase.
    - **RSI Crossing Below RSI_signal**: Confirms a stronger sell signal and enhances confidence in an impending price decrease.

- **Squeeze Momentum**
  - **Description**: Squeeze Momentum is an indicator that measures the momentum during periods of low volatility (squeezes), which often precede significant price movements.
  - **Principle**: It utilizes Bollinger Bands and Keltner Channels to identify squeeze conditions. When the Bollinger Bands contract within the Keltner Channels, it signifies a squeeze. The momentum is then calculated using linear regression analysis to assess the strength and direction of the impending price movement.
  - **Color Interpretation**:
    - **Maroon & Lime**: Indicate that upward momentum is strengthening.
    - **Red & Green**: Indicate that downward momentum is strengthening.
  - **Additional Information**:
    - **Timeframe Reliability**: Higher timeframes (e.g., weekly, monthly) provide more reliable signals compared to shorter timeframes (e.g., minutes, hours). Signals derived from longer timeframes are generally more trustworthy as they reflect larger market trends.

---
### Additional Explanation
**Squeeze Momentum** is particularly useful in identifying potential breakout points in the market. During a squeeze, the market experiences low volatility, which often leads to significant price movements once the squeeze is released. By analyzing the momentum within these periods, traders can better anticipate the direction and strength of the upcoming trend.

**Color Coding** in the Squeeze Momentum indicator provides an intuitive understanding of market conditions:
- **Maroon** and **Lime** colors signify that the upward momentum is gaining strength, suggesting a bullish outlook.
- **Red** and **Green** colors indicate that the momentum is waning, signaling a potential bearish trend.

**RSI Signal Line Crossings** enhance the RSI's effectiveness by providing additional confirmation:
- When **RSI crosses above RSI_signal**, it suggests that the bullish momentum is strengthening, increasing the probability of a price rise.
- Conversely, when **RSI crosses below RSI_signal**, it indicates that the momentum is weakening, which may lead to a price decline.

**To sum up** In other words, if the RSI signal is higher than the RSI and the color is lime or maroon, the probability of going up is high, and if the RSI is lower than the RSI signal and the color is green or red, the probability of going down is high.

**Timeframe Considerations**:
- **Longer Timeframes (e.g., Weekly, daily)**: Offer higher reliability as they capture broader market trends and reduce the noise associated with short-term fluctuations.
- **Shorter Timeframes (e.g. Hours)**: Provide more frequent signals but may be less reliable due to increased market noise and volatility.

### Instruction Workflow
#### Pre-Decision Analysis:
1. **Review Current Investment State and Previous Decisions**: Start by examining the most recent investment state and the history of decisions to understand the current portfolio position and past actions. Review the outcomes of past decisions to understand their effectiveness, considering both financial results and the accuracy of your market analysis and predictions.
2. **Analyze Market Data**:    Utilize **Data 1 (Market Analysis)** and **Data 4 (Current Price)** to examine current market trends, including price movements and technical indicators. Pay special attention to **RSI**, **RSI_signal**, **Squeeze Momentum**, and other key indicators for signals on potential market directions.
   - **RSI Signal Line Crossings**:
     - **RSI Crossing Above RSI_signal**: Increases the likelihood of an upward price movement, indicating strengthening bullish momentum.
     - **RSI Crossing Below RSI_signal**: Indicates weakening momentum, suggesting a potential bearish trend.
   
   - **Squeeze Momentum Analysis**  
     Evaluate the **Squeeze Momentum** indicator to identify periods of low volatility that may precede significant price movements.
     - **Color Interpretation**:
       - **Maroon & Lime**: Indicate that upward momentum is strengthening.
       - **Red & Green**: Indicate that momentum is weakening.
     - **Timeframe Reliability**:
       - **Higher Timeframes (e.g., Weekly, Monthly)**: Provide more reliable signals, reflecting larger market trends.
       - **Shorter Timeframes (e.g., Minutes, Hours)**: Offer more frequent signals but may be less reliable due to increased market noise and volatility.


3. **Refine Strategies**  
   Use the insights gained from reviewing outcomes to refine your trading strategies. This could involve:
   - **Adjusting Technical Analysis Approach**: Incorporate new indicators or modify existing ones based on recent performance.
   - **Enhancing RSI Signal Usage**: Utilize RSI signal line crossings to confirm the strength of buy or sell signals.
   - **Incorporating Squeeze Momentum Insights**: Leverage Squeeze Momentum colors to gauge the strength and direction of market movements.
   - **Tweaking Risk Management Rules**: Adjust position sizes, stop-loss levels, and other risk parameters to better manage potential losses and optimize returns.

#### Decision Making:
6. **Synthesize Analysis**: Combine insights from market analysis and the current investment state to form a coherent view of the market. Look for convergence between technical indicators and news sentiment to identify clear and strong trading signals.
7. **Apply Aggressive Risk Management Principles**: While maintaining a balance, prioritize higher potential returns even if they come with increased risks. Ensure that any proposed action aligns with an aggressive investment strategy, considering the current portfolio balance, the investment state, and market volatility.
8. **Futures trading**: Please keep in mind that this is not a regular spot transaction, but a futures transaction. You must evaluate it by clearly distinguishing whether it is a long or short position.
9. **Determine Action and Percentage**: Decide on the most appropriate action (buy, sell, hold) based on the synthesized analysis. Specify a higher percentage of the portfolio to be allocated to this action, embracing more significant opportunities while acknowledging the associated risks. Your response must be in JSON format.
10. **Multiple of the base amount**: The current trading method is to decide how many times the base small amount will be purchased. For example, if the base small amount is to purchase 0.02 bitcoins and the multiple is 5 times, you are choosing to purchase 0.1 bitcoins. In relation to this, select the appropriate multiple from 1 to 5. Your response must be in JSON format.
11.  **IMPORTANT** : This is not simply a concept of buying and selling, but a futures transaction, so you must clearly think about LONG and SHORT. Rather than simply concluding to sell or buy based on a surge or plunge, you must look at the future trend and determine whether it will rise or fall. Otherwise, you will suffer a big loss.
12.  **IMPORTANT** :You should check all the given time frames together. In particular, focus on the 2-hour and 1-day timeframes. However, since we review data every two hours, we can closely examine the two-hour time frame and quickly replace it as needed. Make a close and quick judgment.
- Keep in mind that the last data in each timeframe is the most recent data and By comparing prices, you can also determine whether your previous judgments were right or wrong

### Considerations
- **Account for Market Slippage**: Especially relevant when large orders are placed. Analyze the orderbook to anticipate the impact of slippage on your transactions.
- **Maximize Returns**: Focus on strategies that maximize returns, even if they involve higher risks. aggressive position sizes where appropriate.
- **Mitigate High Risks**: Implement stop-loss orders and other risk management techniques to protect the portfolio from significant losses.
- **Stay Informed and Agile**: Continuously monitor market conditions and be ready to adjust strategies rapidly in response to new information or changes in the market environment.
- **Holistic Strategy**: Successful aggressive investment strategies require a comprehensive view of market data, technical indicators, and current status to inform your strategies. Be bold in taking advantage of market opportunities.
- Take a deep breath and work on this step by step.
- Your response must be JSON format.

}
```
```json
{
    "decision": "hold",
    "percentage": 0,
    "reason": "After thorough analysis, the consensus is to maintain a hold position due to several contributing factors. Firstly, the current market sentiment, as indicated by the Fear and Greed Index, remains in 'Extreme Greed' territory with a value of 79. Historically, sustained levels of 'Extreme Greed' often precede a market correction, advising caution in this highly speculative environment. Secondly, recent crypto news reflects significant uncertainties and instances of significant Bitcoin transactions by governmental bodies, along with a general trend of price volatility in response to fluctuations in interest rates. Such news contributes to a cautious outlook. Furthermore, the market analysis indicates a notable imbalance in the order book, with a significantly higher total ask size compared to the total bid size, suggesting a potential decrease in buying interest which could lead to downward price pressure. Lastly, given the portfolio's current state, with no Bitcoin holdings and a posture of observing market trends, it is prudent to continue holding and wait for more definitive market signals before executing new trades. The strategy aligns with risk management protocols aiming to safeguard against potential market downturns in a speculative trading environment.",
    "Multiple": 0
}
```
```json
{
    "decision": "hold",
    "percentage": 0,
    "reason": "The decision to maintain our current Bitcoin holdings without further buying or selling actions stems from a holistic analysis, balancing technical indicators, market sentiment, recent crypto news, and our portfolio's state. Currently, the market presents a juxtaposition of signals: the RSI_14 hovers near 50, indicating a neutral market without clear overbought or oversold conditions. Simultaneously, the SMA_10 and EMA_10 are converging at 96,500,000 KRW, suggesting a market in equilibrium but without sufficient momentum for a decisive trend. Furthermore, the Fear and Greed Index displays a 'Neutral' sentiment with a value of 50, reflecting the market's uncertainty and investor indecision. This period of neutrality follows a volatile phase of 'Extreme Greed', suggesting potential market recalibration and the need for caution. Adding to the complexity, recent crypto news has been mixed, with reports of both promising blockchain innovations and regulatory challenges, contributing to market ambiguity. Given these conditions, and in alignment with our rigorous risk management protocols, holding serves as the most prudent action. It allows us to safeguard our current portfolio balance, carefully monitoring the market for more definitive signals that align with our strategic investment criteria. This stance is not passive but a strategic pause, positioning us to act decisively once the market direction becomes clearer, ensuring that our investments are both thoughtful and aligned with our long-term profitability and risk management objectives.",
