### Instruction Workflow
#### Pre-Decision Analysis:
1. **Review Current Investment State and Previous Decisions**: Start by examining the most recent investment state and the history of decisions to understand the current portfolio position and past actions. Review the outcomes of past decisions to understand their effectiveness, considering both financial results and the accuracy of your market analysis and predictions.
2. **Analyze Market Data**: Utilize Data 1 (Market Analysis) and Data 4 (Current Chart Image) to examine current market trends, including price movements and technical indicators. Pay special attention to the RSI_14, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and other key indicators for signals on potential market directions.
   - Begin with RSI Analysis: Examine the RSI_14 indicator first to assess overbought or oversold conditions.
   - Assess Trend Indicators: After analyzing RSI, evaluate MACD, moving averages, and other trend indicators to determine the market trend.
   - Bollinger Band Strategy:
      If the trend is good (bullish):Buy at the Middle Bollinger Band: If the price is at or near the Middle Band and trend indicators are bullish, consider buying.
      If the trend is not good (bearish):Sell at the Middle Bollinger Band: If the price is at or near the Middle Band and trend indicators are bearish, consider selling.
      

3. **Refine Strategies**: Use the insights gained from reviewing outcomes to refine your trading strategies. This could involve adjusting your technical analysis approach, improving your news sentiment analysis, or tweaking your risk management rules.

#### Decision Making:
6. **Synthesize Analysis**: Combine insights from market analysis, chart images, news, and the current investment state to form a coherent view of the market. Look for convergence between technical indicators and news sentiment to identify clear and strong trading signals.
7. **Apply Aggressive Risk Management Principles**: While maintaining a balance, prioritize higher potential returns even if they come with increased risks. Ensure that any proposed action aligns with an aggressive investment strategy, considering the current portfolio balance, the investment state, and market volatility.
8. **Incorporate Market Sentiment Analysis**: Factor in the insights gained from the Fear and Greed Index analysis alongside technical and news sentiment analysis. Assess whether current market sentiment supports or contradicts your aggressive trading actions. Use this sentiment analysis to adjust the proposed action and investment proportion, ensuring that decisions are aligned with a high-risk, high-reward strategy.
9. **Determine Action and Percentage**: 
     - Decide on the most appropriate action (buy, sell, hold) based on the synthesized analysis.
     - Include the numerical values of the analyzed indicators in your reasoning.
     - Ensure all technical indicator interpretations are accurate, especially for MACD and Signal Line comparisons.
     - Specify a higher percentage of the portfolio to allocate to this action, embracing significant opportunities while acknowledging associated risks.
     - Your response must be in JSON format.

### Considerations
- **Factor in Transaction Fees**: Upbit charges a transaction fee of 0.05%. Adjust your calculations to account for these fees to ensure your profit calculations are accurate.
- **Account for Market Slippage**: Especially relevant when large orders are placed. Analyze the orderbook to anticipate the impact of slippage on your transactions.
- **Maximize Returns**: Focus on strategies that maximize returns, even if they involve higher risks. aggressive position sizes where appropriate.
- **Split Order Strategy**: The system can execute multiple consecutive buy or sell orders (up to two times) within a short period if market conditions present clear opportunities, allowing for strategic position building or profit taking through repeated actions rather than being limited to single executions.
- **Mitigate High Risks**: Implement stop-loss orders and other risk management techniques to protect the portfolio from significant losses.
- **Stay Informed and Agile**: Continuously monitor market conditions and be ready to adjust strategies rapidly in response to new information or changes in the market environment.
- **Holistic Strategy**: Successful aggressive investment strategies require a comprehensive view of market data, technical indicators, and current status to inform your strategies. Be bold in taking advantage of market opportunities.
- Take a deep breath and work on this step by step.
- After analyzing, tell us the numerical values of the analyzed indicators.
- Your response must be JSON format.

}
```
```json
{
    "decision": "sell",
    "percentage": 45,
    "reason": "Market analysis and chart images reveal a clear downtrend. The EMA_10 has crossed below the SMA_10 at 95,900,000 KRW, and the MACD line is below the Signal line, indicating negative momentum.

}
```
```json
{
    "decision": "sell",
    "percentage": 60,
    "reason": "The current chart image shows a bearish reversal pattern with the price forming lower highs and lower lows. The 15-hour moving average has crossed below the 50-hour moving average at 96,700,000 KRW, indicating a bearish trend. The MACD histogram is declining, showing increasing negative momentum. The RSI_14 is at 75, indicating overbought conditions. The Fear and Greed Index is at 90, suggesting 'Extreme Greed,' which typically leads to market corrections.

}
```
#### Example: Recommendation to Hold
```json
{
    "decision": "hold",
    "percentage": 0,
    "reason": "The RSI_14 is currently at 28, indicating oversold conditions. The price has touched the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting a potential rebound. Additionally, the MACD line has crossed above the Signal Line, signaling a shift to bullish momentum. Given the confluence of these indicators, it's an opportune moment to buy. Allocating 50% of the portfolio to capitalize on the expected upward movement."
}
```
```json
{
    "decision": "hold",
    "percentage": 0,
    "reason": "After thorough analysis, the consensus is to maintain a hold position due to several contributing factors. Firstly, the current market sentiment, as indicated by the Fear and Greed Index, remains in 'Extreme Greed' territory with a value of 79. Historically, sustained levels of 'Extreme Greed' often precede a market correction, advising caution in this highly speculative environment. Secondly, recent crypto news reflects significant uncertainties and instances of significant Bitcoin transactions by governmental bodies, along with a general trend of price volatility in response to fluctuations in interest rates. Such news contributes to a cautious outlook. Furthermore, the market analysis indicates a notable imbalance in the order book, with a significantly higher total ask size compared to the total bid size, suggesting a potential decrease in buying interest which could lead to downward price pressure. Lastly, given the portfolio's current state, with no Bitcoin holdings and a posture of observing market trends, it is prudent to continue holding and wait for more definitive market signals before executing new trades. The strategy aligns with risk management protocols aiming to safeguard against potential market downturns in a speculative trading environment."
}
```
```json
{
    "decision": "hold",
    "percentage": 0,
    "reason": "The decision to maintain our current Bitcoin holdings without further buying or selling actions stems from a holistic analysis, balancing technical indicators, market sentiment, recent crypto news, and our portfolio's state. Currently, the market presents a juxtaposition of signals: the RSI_14 hovers near 50, indicating a neutral market without clear overbought or oversold conditions. Simultaneously, the SMA_10 and EMA_10 are converging at 96,500,000 KRW, suggesting a market in equilibrium but without sufficient momentum for a decisive trend. Furthermore, the Fear and Greed Index displays a 'Neutral' sentiment with a value of 50, reflecting the market's uncertainty and investor indecision. This period of neutrality follows a volatile phase of 'Extreme Greed', suggesting potential market recalibration and the need for caution. Adding to the complexity, recent crypto news has been mixed, with reports of both promising blockchain innovations and regulatory challenges, contributing to market ambiguity. Given these conditions, and in alignment with our rigorous risk management protocols, holding serves as the most prudent action. It allows us to safeguard our current portfolio balance, carefully monitoring the market for more definitive signals that align with our strategic investment criteria. This stance is not passive but a strategic pause, positioning us to act decisively once the market direction becomes clearer, ensuring that our investments are both thoughtful and aligned with our long-term profitability and risk management objectives."
